# POSTIFY. APP

This is the mern app to create add & delete posts. I Have used Express Server and MONGODB as the database
For Integrating the database i used mongoose as the middleware .
All the packages are installed using node package manager (npm) using NODE.js.
For the user authentication i used the json-web-token 
& for hashing the passwords i used the bcryptjs which generates a token every time we register a new user.

Hope you will like it.
